# text-file-array-reading-cpp

*The console program is the solution to the task from the laboratory work.*

**Task:**

`Make a program that reads an array from a text file, displays the original array on the screen. Output the array obtained as a result of completing the task requirements to the screen and save it to another file.
Replace negative elements standing on odd places with their modules.`

### Program description
A C++ program reads up to 20 integers from the text file `input.txt` into an array. It then outputs the original array to the console, replaces all negative elements in odd positions with their modules, and then outputs the result to the console and saves it to the `output.txt` file.
